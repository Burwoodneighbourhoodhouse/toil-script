#  TOIL Work Hours Tracker

A simple program for tracking **TOIL** hours — add hours when you work extra and use them when you take time off

##  Features

-  See your current TOIL balance  
-  Add earned TOIL hours with a date  
-  Use hours when taking time off  
-  View a full history of your entries  
-  Automatically saves data in local browser storage (no server needed)

##  How It Works

The app stores your hours using the browser’s **localStorage**, so your data stays saved even after closing the page.

There are 3 main sections:
1. **Add Hours** — Record extra hours worked  
2. **Use Hours** — Use hours to apply for time off  
3. **View Entries** — See all your entries and current balance

##  How to Use

1. Clone or download the repo  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. Start tracking your TOIL!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/toil-tracker.git
cd toil-tracker
open index.html
